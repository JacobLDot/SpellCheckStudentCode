| September 24 | 12:45 - 1:15 pm  |                                                                                                                                                         I was initially focusing on using arraylists, but then realized we had to manage duplicates since add will add duplicates, and apparently this thing called hashsets fixes that and has a runtime of o(1) which is faster than o(n). I changed 2 lines and made it faster I think. The way I thought about this problem was to go through every word in the dictionary once, and then go through every word in the text, and if its not in the dictionary then just simply add iti to the misspelled words. |

To accomplish this I thought about using low, medium, and high points and modifying them based on the result of comparing the midword to the word in the text. I figured that if none of the values matched the value in the dictionary, then it would be misspelled and I add it to the misspelled list. |

| October 5    |  7:30 - 8:30 am  | I started doing the trie inserting and searching as a replacement of binary search, my thinking was basically just reviewing the slides, since there was a lot of helpful stuff there. I figured that basically I would have to build the trie from the dictionary first, then follow the lookup method for each word in our text, and then add it to the misspelled words list. I am going to start adding modifications to make it faster. I think to do this I should try  to figure out how to do TSTS. Im thinking that I just need to modify my already current methods to suit for a left, right and middle. I am going to start that now hopefuly it works. |

I think i somehow got it sorta working its just insanely slow like its slower than my binary search. |
