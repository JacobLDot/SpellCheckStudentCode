| September 24 | 12:45 - 1:15 pm  | I was initially focusing on using arraylists, but then realized we had to manage duplicates since add will add duplicates, and apparently this thing called hashsets fixes that and has a runtime of o(1) which is faster than o(n). I changed 2 lines and made it faster I think. The way I thought about this problem was to go through every word in the dictionary once, and then go through every word in the text, and if its not in the dictionary then just simply add iti to the misspelled words. |

To accomplish this I thought about using low, medium, and high points and modifying them based on the result of comparing the midword to the word in the text. I figured that if none of the values matched the value in the dictionary, then it would be misspelled and I add it to the misspelled list. |
